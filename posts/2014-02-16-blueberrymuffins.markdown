When the [original gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_%28alcoholic_beverage%29) (OG) (relative density compared to water) of [yesterday's](http://www.sketchbrewing.com/2014/02/coffee-stout-round-2.html) chocoloate coffee stout read only `1.044`, we disolved all the sugar in the house into the wort, which raised the OG to a more acceptable level of `1.055`. Thus today when I decided to make blueberry muffins, I found we had no sugar. If not in Bavaria, I'd probably have gone to der Supermarkt to buy Zucker. But since every store except those in the [Hauptbahnhof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchen_Hauptbahnhof) is closed, I opted for the more mellifluous harmony of honey and applesauce.

Their tops cracked nicely, exposing blueberries within. The blueberry-to-dough ratio is very high, almost `1:1`. They are not particularly sweet, but this is balanced out by the copious blueberries. My only beef with these muffins is that their tops turned out a touch too brown. I've eaten two muffins while writing this post. Yum.
