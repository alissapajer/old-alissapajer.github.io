<p style="margin: 0px"><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
 * `1.5 cups flour` (*Weizenmehl Vollkorn*)  
 * `0.5 cups oats` (*Dinkelflocken Kleinblatt*)   
 * `15g baking powder` (*Backpulver*)  
 * `0.25 teaspoons salt`  
 * `0.25 cups sweetened applesauce`  
 * `1 egg`  
 * `0.875 cups soymilk`  
 * <code style="padding: 5px 5px">3<sup>-1</sup> cups sugar</code>
 * `0.5 cups crushed pecans`
 * `300g frozen raspberries`


**Temperature:** <code>190<b>&deg;</b> C</code>

**Bake Time:** `~24 minutes`

While mixing the dough, I thought I had added too many raspberries, but after eating a baked muffin, I concluded that the amout of raspberries is perfect. The dough itself is a dense, due to the oats and the pecans. And the raspberries are very juicy.
