<p>How can we change the order of the arguments to a function? After I answered this question, I realized it’s actually a very odd question to ask.</p>
<p>I’m working my way though <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>, and in the <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions#curried-functions">Curried Functions</a> section, the author describes the Haskell function <code>flip</code> like so: <em>“Flip simply takes a function and returns a function that is like our original function, only the first two arguments are flipped.”</em> Without scrolling down further, I decided to implement <code>flip</code> based on this sentence alone.</p>
<p>I started with the type signature</p>
<pre><code>myFlip :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; c)</code></pre>
<p>and my first attempt at implementation trailed off rather quickly:</p>
<pre><code>myFlip f = ...</code></pre>
<p>Given only a function <code>f :: a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code>, and nothing to apply to it, I had reached a dead end, so I decided to implement <code>f</code>, and then <code>flip</code> this implementation. I wanted the type variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> to be distinct so I could easily keep track of them. Here’s my function:</p>
<pre><code>myImpl :: Char -&gt; Bool -&gt; String
myImpl char bool = char : (show bool)</code></pre>
<p>And now to flip it!</p>
<pre><code>flippedMyImpl :: Bool -&gt; Char -&gt; String
flippedMyImpl bool char = myImpl char bool</code></pre>
<p>Well, that is simple enough. The types lead way! And suddenly I realized that I just might have access to type variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. But I needed to implement the full signature of <code>myFlip</code> using these specific types to fully understand. I combined <code>myImpl</code> and <code>flippedMyImpl</code> to produce</p>
<pre><code>flipWithTypes :: (Char -&gt; Bool -&gt; String) -&gt; Bool -&gt; Char -&gt; String
flipWithTypes f bool char = f char bool</code></pre>
<p>My key realization was that I could remove the parentheses around <code>(Bool -&gt; Char -&gt; String)</code> without changing the type signature. Once I did this, I realized that I had access to two more function arguments! Before removing the parentheses, my mind had written off <code>(b -&gt; a -&gt; c)</code> as an impenetrable block.</p>
<p>Once I wrote this last implementation, it was immediately clear that I had just written a non-parametric version of <code>myFlip</code>. There is nothing special about the types I had chosen; they could just as easily be type variables. And so we arrive at our solution:</p>
<pre><code>myFlip :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c
myFlip f b a = f a b</code></pre>
<p>To implement <code>myFlip</code>, we needed to determine how the function would handle itself when fully applied. But our goal in writing <code>myFlip</code> is to return another (partially applied) function with type <code>b -&gt; a -&gt; c</code>. The key to the implementation of <code>flip</code> that wasn’t obvious at first is that we need to provide a full implementation in order to later partially apply it.</p>
<p>In doing this exercise, my conception of a function changed. Now when I think of a function, I think of something linear, something in which each parameter must be applied in its prescribed order. And if that order is to be broken, another function must be applied to faciliate this change in order.</p>
<p>Really, <code>flip</code> is a formalization of how we handle the permutations of function application orders in Haskell. In math, we’ve seen that given a function <code>f(x,y,z)</code>, we can consider <code>g(y,z) = f(3,y,z)</code> or <code>h(y) = f(5,y,6)</code> without any concern, because the order in which we provide values for our variables doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>But since in Haskell all functions take exactly one parameter, and thus multi-parameter functions are a semantic illusion, one must make explicit how to pass in parameters in a different order. Hence we arrive at the <code>flip</code> function.</p>
<p>To tie up this post, it’s odd, from a non-functional point of view, to ask how we can flip the order of function arguments because the question assumes that function arguments have an order in the first place! Though, once you recall the definitions of lambda calculus and think about different reduction rules, the fact that functions innately order their parameters seems almost intuitive. And then I realized: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Rosser_theorem">Church-Rosser</a>. And guess what? I’ve already written a blog post about that.</p>

    <title>Category Theory at Strange Loop 2013</title>

<p><img src="/images/diagram.png" title="diagram" alt="diagram" /> Back in September 2013 I gave a talk titled “Category Theory: An Abstraction for Anything” at the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop Conference</a>. A few days ago, the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/category-theory">video</a> for my talk was released.</p>
<p>Additionally, I wrote a <a href="http://engineering.richrelevance.com/closing-the-loop-on-category-theory-polymorphism-currying-and-more/">blog post</a> about this talk that was published on my employer’s blog.</p>
<p>Here’s the talk abstract, reproduced from the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/category-theory-an-abstraction-for-anything">Strange Loop website</a>:</p>
<p><em>Category theory provides a mathematically sound foundation on which we can create collections of objects and express morphisms between them. Together, along with a few simple rules, a collection of objects and morphisms forms a category to which we can apply many useful results, such as the uniqueness of an identity morphism. Furthermore, once we have a category in hand, we can formally explore the relationships it has with other categories, deducing powerful and practical abstractions.</em></p>
<p><em>The power of category theory lies in the relative simplicity and accessibility of its definitions. From just a handful of straightforward concepts, we can formalize many concrete ideas such as directed acyclic graphs, currying, polymorphic functions, and Haskell itself. This talk will introduce the basics of category theory, while simultaneously diving into specific programming-related examples of categories, functors, and natural transformations. In addition to exploring profound and beautiful concepts, this talk aims to provide you with the tools necessary to recognize category-theoretical patterns in your own programming projects.</em></p>

    <title>Blueberry Honey Muffins</title>

<p>When the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_%28alcoholic_beverage%29">original gravity</a> (OG) (relative density compared to water) of <a href="http://www.sketchbrewing.com/2014/02/coffee-stout-round-2.html">yesterday’s</a> chocoloate coffee stout read only <code>1.044</code>, we dissolved all the sugar in the house into the wort, which raised the OG to a more acceptable level of <code>1.055</code>. Thus today when I decided to make blueberry muffins, I found we had no sugar. If not in Bavaria, I’d probably have gone to der Supermarkt to buy Zucker. But since every store except those in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchen_Hauptbahnhof">Hauptbahnhof</a> is closed, I opted for the more mellifluous harmony of honey and applesauce.</p>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/bRXvQ5F.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bRXvQ5Fl.jpg" title="blueberry muffins" alt="BlueberryMuffins" /></a>
<p style="margin: 0px">
<b>Ingredients:</b>
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><code>1.5 cups flour</code> (<em>Weizenmehl Vollkorn</em>)<br /></li>
<li><code>0.5 cups oats</code> (<em>Dinkelflocken Kleinblatt</em>)<br /></li>
<li><code>15g baking powder</code> (<em>Backpulver</em>)<br /></li>
<li><code>0.25 teaspoons salt</code><br /></li>
<li><code>0.5 cups sweetened applesauce</code><br /></li>
<li><code>2 eggs</code><br /></li>
<li><code>1.5 teaspoons vanilla</code><br /></li>
<li><code>0.5 cups soymilk</code><br /></li>
<li><code style="padding: 5px 5px">3<sup>-1</sup> cups honey</code> (<em>Eukalyptus Honig</em>)<br /></li>
<li><code>350g frozen blueberries</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Temperature:</strong> <code>190<b>°</b> C</code></p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> <code>~21 minutes</code></p>
<p><strong>Music:</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korobeiniki">Korobeiniki</a> (aka <em>The Tetris Song</em>)</p>
<p>Their tops cracked nicely, exposing blueberries within. The blueberry-to-dough ratio is very high, almost <code>1:1</code>. They are not particularly sweet, but this is balanced out by the copious blueberries. My only beef with these muffins is that their tops turned out a touch too brown. I’ve eaten two muffins while writing this post. Yum.</p>

    <title>Blog Setup</title>
    <link>http://alissapajer.github.io/posts/2014-02-08-blogsetup.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="info">
    Posted on February  8, 2014

</div>

<p>When I started my search for a static site generator, I first came across <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. I’m not particularly excited about learning Ruby, but I am excited about learning Haskell. <img src="/images/HaskellRuby.png" title="HaskellRuby" alt="HaskellRuby" /> This quickly led me to <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>. Hakyll is easy to install with <code>cabal</code>, though the first time I installed it I had an old version of <code>cabal</code>, and thus installed an apparently very old version of Hakyll. I remedied this as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ ghc-pkg unregister hakyll
$ cabal update
$ cabal install hakyll</code></pre>
<p>From there I followed the <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials.html">Tutorials</a> on the Hakyll site and found them clear and up to date. Once I built the <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/01-installation.html#building-the-example-site">Example Site</a> locally, it was time to move the example code to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. Blogging without version control was out of the question!</p>
<p>The most confusing part of github pages is the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">difference</a> between User Pages and Project Pages. The difference is mostly confusing because you can have a <code>gh-pages</code> branch in the repo <code>username/username.github.io</code>. In that case github needs to make an undocumented choice about which branch to use. I decided to use User Pages, which is why you can find my blog at <code>http://alissapajer.github.io</code>. This means that content from my <code>master</code> branch will be used to build my website. Here is where things get a bit tricky.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>I need the contents of my site in the directory <code>alissapajer.github.io/</code> on the <code>master</code> branch. But Hakyll generates the website itself in <code>alissapajer.github.io/_site/</code>, and places the Haskell code, markdown, and various other files in the top level directory. And of course I need to version control everything, generated and not!</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>I created a <code>source</code> branch, which contains both the manually-created and the generated files. When I make a change to my website, I always commit on the <code>source</code> branch, and I never manually edit files on <code>master</code>. The idea is that <code>source</code> will contain all of my code, and <code>master</code> will contain just the generated files. Now all we need to do is to copy the contents of the <code>_site/</code> directory to the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<p>To perform this copy, I use <a href="https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import">ghp-import</a> as follows, run from the <code>source</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code>$ ghp-import _site/ -b master -m &quot;commit message&quot;</code></pre>
<p>There is an optional flag to push to <code>master</code>, but I have been pushing manually so I can review the changes first. And that’s it! The only thing I still need to do is the redirect to a domain I own. This is done using a <code>CNAME</code> file on the <code>master</code> branch. Since my <code>master</code> branch is auto-generated I’ll need to add this <code>CNAME</code> in such a way that it’s not deleted when I commit to <code>master</code>.</p>
<p>The only weird thing is that <code>source</code> and <code>master</code> will permanently diverge.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>While editing the webiste, I run</p>
<pre><code>$ ./site watch</code></pre>
<p>This command registers changes to the <code>_site/</code> directory and publishes the up-to-date website to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/</code>. Very useful for immediate feedback!</p>
<p>Also, Hakyll allows you to write all your blog posts in markdown. I’ve found this <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown Cheatsheet</a> essential.</p>
