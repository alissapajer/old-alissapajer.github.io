            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>Alissa Pajer began her functional programming career as a Scala engineer at <a href="https://github.com/slamdata/platform">Precog</a>. She worked there for two years, until Precog was acquired by <a href="http://www.richrelevance.com/">RichRelevance</a>, her current employer. Before her coding days, she studied pure mathematics, earning a Bachelors from Carleton College in Minnesota, and a Masters from the University of Colorado at Boulder. The topics that most interest her are category theory, type theory, Scala, Haskell, and Idris. She currently lives in Munich, Germany, where she spends her non-computer time hiking, skiing, running, swimming, cycling, and buying groceries.</p>
